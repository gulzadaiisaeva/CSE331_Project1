## CSE331_Project1

Design a digital circuit that detects which of the two 5-bit input numbers (InA and InB) is larger. 

The circuit will output a two bit signal called Out such that: 

Situation Out =

InA = InB     => 00
InA > InB     => 01
InA &lt; InB  => 10 
InA = InB â‰  0 => 11


Use structural Verilog and Quartus.
